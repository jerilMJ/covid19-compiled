Please keep in mind that this data comes from [CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) so first, 
you should look to see if the issue is also present there. If so, file an issue there, else here.

The data is retrieved from these 3 csv files:
- [Confirmed data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv)
- [Deaths data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv)
- [Recovered data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv)

Also, keep in mind that the data will never be 100% accurate and so, you might observe discrepencies sometimes.
